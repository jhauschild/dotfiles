This is my window-manager setup.
I had planned to switch to sway with wayland. However, for now some programs don't work yet with wayland, so I've got a dual-setup supporting both i3 and sway, with basically almost identical setup.





Requirements:

Fedora:
```bash
sudo dnf install \
	dmenu rofi  \
	i3 polybar xset xdotool nitrogen \
	sway wtype waybar \
```
